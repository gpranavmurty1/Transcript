# PRD: Smart Onboarding Companion
## 3. Product Vision

**"A Companion, not a Portal."**

The product understands:
1. **Who the user is** — Role: Engineer, Product Manager, or Designer
2. **Where they are in their journey** — Day 1, Week 1, or Week 2
3. **What they need to do next** — Guided, role-specific milestones, not a dump of links

The goal: shift new hires from *"I have the links, but I'm lost"* to *"I know exactly what to do today."*
