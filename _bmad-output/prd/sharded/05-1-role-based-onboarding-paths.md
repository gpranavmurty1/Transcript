### 5.1. Role-Based Onboarding Paths

- The Companion detects the new hire's role (Engineering, Product, or Design) at login.
- **Role Display Names:**
  - **Product** → Product Manager
  - **Design** → Product Designer
  - **Engineering** → Software Craftsperson
- All content, milestones, team directories, and Notion resources displayed are **specific to that role**.
- A Designer sees Figma resources and Design team directory; an Engineer sees the tech stack and engineering crew leads.
