# PRD: Smart Onboarding Companion
## 11. Risks & Mitigations

- **Data Integrity ("Garbage In, Garbage Out"):**
  - *Risk:* Many existing Notion docs are outdated. Surfacing these will mislead new hires.
  - *Mitigation:* A mandatory "Notion Curation" phase precedes launch. Only flagged "Holy Grail" docs are ingested.

- **Cultural Isolation:**
  - *Risk:* Removing the need to ask humans questions may reduce social bonding.
  - *Mitigation:* The Companion explicitly prompts human 1-on-1 connections as structured milestones, not optional suggestions.

- **Maintenance Overhead:**
  - *Risk:* The Companion becomes another outdated artifact.
  - *Mitigation:* Milestone and directory content is maintained in a simple admin-editable config; no AI training required.

- **Scope Creep:**
  - *Risk:* Stakeholders add features mid-build (AI, integrations) and delay the 2-month MVP.
  - *Mitigation:* Out of scope section (Section 6) is signed off by all stakeholders before development starts.
