# PRD: Smart Onboarding Companion
## 2. Problem Statement

- **Prolonged Time-to-Productivity:** New hires take an average of five weeks to contribute meaningfully, a delay largely attributed to the lack of structured guidance.
- **Remote Isolation & Fragmented Onboarding:** In a remote-first environment, new roles like Product Managers lack a clear roadmap of stakeholders or resources. Onboarding is often relegated to a static email checklist, forcing hires to navigate the organization through self-directed Slack outreach rather than guided integration.
- **The "Wiki Trap" (Information Overload):** Employees have access to thousands of documents on Notion but lack the **context** to know what is relevant versus obsolete.
- **Social Friction:** New hires suffer from "social anxiety," fearing they will look incompetent if they ask basic questions.
- **Static & Inefficient Processes:** The current "Welcome Pack" is generic, treating Engineering, Product, and Design roles identically.
