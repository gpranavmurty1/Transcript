## 1. Overview

The Smart Onboarding Companion is a **role-aware, milestone-driven web application** that guides new hires (Engineering, Product, Design) through a structured 2-week onboarding journey. It replaces ad-hoc email checklists and Slack self-navigation with a curated, role-specific experience that gets new hires contributing meaningfully within 2 weeks instead of 5.

**This is NOT:**
- A learning management system
- A performance management tool
- A conversational AI chatbot (deferred post-MVP)
